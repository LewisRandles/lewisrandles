## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer with a passion for creating clean, user-friendly websites and web applications. I enjoy working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks such as React to build fast, reliable and responsive websites.

When Iâ€™m not coding, you can find me exploring my other interests:

- Astronomy: Stargazing and learning about space and the universe.

- Aviation: Fascinated by flight mechanics and aircraft design.

- Rocketry: Following the latest in space exploration and rocketry innovations.

- Meteorology: Ties in greatly with tracking planes, rockets and the stars.
